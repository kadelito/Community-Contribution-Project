# MIDI Visualizer for Drummers
#### Video Demo: <strong>URL HERE</strong>
### Main Description:
This program was originally a final project for one of my classes. Its purpose was to solve some problem in a community (*drummers struggling to learn songs, in my case*), and my approach was to take MIDI files, which can represent any song, and, along with playing the song's audio, show visually how one would play the drums to the song.
### File Structure
This project was generated with IntelliJ Idea, so most of it is just "boilerplate" to make it work. The important files are in `src/main`.

In the `resources/` folder are a few MIDI files I use for testing, along with the image of a drum kit, on top of which the main animation is played (*and a few other drum images currently left unused*).
